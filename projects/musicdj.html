			<h1>MusicDJ</h1>
			<p>MusicDJ is an old application included on old Sony Ericsson phones which let you made tracks based on pre-defined sounds. The tracks were saved on a .midi format, meaning what you could finish editing them on a PC before converting them to MP3. Unfortunately, when Sony Ericsson was converted into Sony Mobile Communications, this application was forgotten.</p>
			<h2>Our plans</h2>
			<p>HG managed to get all the sounds from the application, to start re-creating this application for PC. With our knowledge about websites, we will write an online application as it was on the old Sony Ericsson website. There was a standalone version in the works, but unfortunately, Njifra decided to leave the team. This means there won't be any plans for a standalone version right now.</p>
