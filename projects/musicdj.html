			<h1>MusicDJ</h1>
			<p>MusicDJ is an old application included on old Sony Ericsson phones which let you made tracks based on pre-defined sounds. The tracks were saved on a .midi format, meaning what you could finish editing them on a PC before converting them to MP3. Unfortunately, when Sony Ericsson was converted into Sony Mobile Communications, this appliaction was forgotten.</p>
			<h2>Our plans</h2>
			<p>HG managed to get all the sounds from the application, to start re-creating this application, for PC. Njifra will code it starting with a basic design, then styles will be added. But what really matters is that the application can play the audio.</p>
