			<h3>Njifra</h3>
			<p>Njifra was an old member of Kock Projects. He knows C++ and Lua programming languages. He also made the Curve Fever 2 game clan "KOCK", which is the reason of the existence of Kock Projects. During one of our projects (MusicDJ), he left the team. However, he was re-incorporated the same day! But then the same issue happened. Only that this time instead, he claimed that he would not make MusicDJ, that he would make his own project with his own team. He basically got our sources and used them as his own sources. That has gotten him out of the team, forever. He already decided to leave before the ban!</p>
