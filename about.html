			<h1>About us</h1>
			<h2>Actual Members</h2>
			<h3>HG</h3>
			<p>HG is the main owner of Kock Projects, as a Python, HTML, CSS and PHP scripts programmer. Not to mention that he has excellent graphic skills.</p>
			<h3>bulldozer</h3>
			<p>bulldozer owns the website which is written by HG and bulldozer himself. He can write some basic stuff in Python, HTML, JavaScript and CSS.</p>
			<h2>Former Members</h2>
			<h3>Njifra</h3>
			<p>Njifra was named the brain. He knows C++ and Lua programming languages. He also made the Curve Fever 2 game clan "KOCK", which is the reason of the existence of Kock Projects. However, during one of our projects (MusicDJ) there were fights claiming that he was making the application when HG and bulldozer suggested to make an online version. Therefore, with Kock Projects being a group of projects made by the team, and not only by one of the members, Njifra has left the team.</p>
